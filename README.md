# Readings in Databases

A list of papers essential to understanding databases and building new data systems.


## Basics and Algorithms
* [The Five-Minute Rule Ten Years Later, and Other Computer Storage Rules of Thumb](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/5-min-rule.pdf): This paper (and the original one proposed 10 years earlier) illustrates a quantitative formula to calculate whether a data page should be cached in memory or not. It is a delight to read Jim Gray approach to an array of related problems, e.g. how big should a page size be.

* [Paxos Made Simple](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/Paxos.pdf): Paxos is a fault-tolerant distributed consensus protocol. It forms the basis of a wide variety of distributed systems. The idea is simple, but notoriously difficult to understand (perhaps due to the way the original Paxos paper was written).

* [AlphaSort: A Cache-Sensitive Parallel External Sort](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rxin/db-papers/alphasort.pdf): cache-friendly sorting
